# GildedChunkSpamFix

As the description says, this fixes gilded drones, friendly monsters, or any AI that is a gilded elite spawning so many gold chunks the game lags out and practically crashes.

It does this by making both players AND drones/monsters/any AI use a cooldown for how often gold chunks can spawn. Only players have this normally, which leads to monsters not having a cooldown and crashing games with gold.

<sub><sup>it's still possible to have gold spam from players getting hit but i'm very sure that'll never happen in normal gameplay</sup></sub>
